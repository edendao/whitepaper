## Raw Thoughts

An exponential curve is not useful because it leads to more speculation later on. A logarithmic curve would be better, then level off to something linear.

The first curve is for the native token EDEN. Deposits are held by the Eden Vault. These tokens represent a proportional allocation of the yield earned from yield farming. There is a decreasing exit tax. The taxed coins are re-invested into the EDEN token.

EDEN can be used to buy startup coins. Startup coins are priced in EDEN and also operate on a logarithmic bonding curve. A startup's EDEN entitles them to a proportional allocation of the yield generated from the reserve in the Eden Vault.
